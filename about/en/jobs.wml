		About the company:<br>
		 The Tor Project is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to research,
		 development, and education about online anonymity and privacy. The Tor
		 network's 6000 volunteer relays carry 48 Gbps for several
		 million daily users, including ordinary citizens who want protection
		 from identity theft and prying corporations, corporations who want
		 to look at a competitor's website in private, people around the world
		 whose Internet connections are censored, and even governments and law
		 enforcement. Tor has a staff of 30 paid developers, researchers, and
		 advocates, plus many dozen volunteers who help out on a daily basis. Tor
		 is funded in part by government research and development grants, and
		 in part by individual and corporate donations.
